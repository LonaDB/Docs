## Prerequisites

To run the LonaDB server, make sure you have the following software installed:

- Node.js (version 12 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

To install the LonaDB server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LonaDB/Hadro.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Hadro
```

3. Install the dependencies and start the server:

```bash
npm install
node hadro
```

If you don't have a configuration file, a users file or any tables, the setup script will run you through initial setup and create everything needed for the database to run.

4. Use your database:

Thats it! 
You now have your own instance of LonaDB's server, Hadro!
